## Phase 1 - Setup

### Step 1.1 - Ask project type

Use `AskUserQuestion`:
- question: "What type of project is this?"
- header: "Project type"
- options:
  - label: "Single Repo"
    description: "One language/concern, personal projects, libraries, single-service apps"
  - label: "Monorepo"
    description: "Multiple parts (api, frontend, infra), multi-team, multiple package.json"

### Step 1.2 - Identify parts (MONOREPO only)

Skip this step for single repo.

Do NOT scan or auto-detect parts. Simply output this message and wait for the user to type their answer:

```
List your monorepo parts (one path per line), e.g.:
  apps/api
  apps/web
  packages/infra
```

The user will type the paths. Store the confirmed parts list for use in `Step 1.4` and all agents. Part name is inferred from the last path segment (e.g. `apps/api` → `api`).

### Step 1.3 - Ask which docs to SKIP

All docs are generated by default. Display the numbered list below and ask the user to type which numbers to skip. For monorepo, include items 8-9. For single repo, only show items 1-8.

```
All docs below are generated by default. Type numbers to skip (e.g. "1,3") or press enter to keep all:

1. concepts.md       - domain glossary
2. db.md             - data model, migrations, caching
3. cicd.md           - CI/CD pipelines, deploy workflows
4. guides/           - how-to docs, recipes
5. features/         - one doc per feature
6. rules.md          - principles, conventions
7. problems/         - solved problems log
8. integrations.md   - 3rd party service integrations
9. parts/            - per-part overview + rules + guides   (monorepo only)
```

NOTE: overview.md, architecture.md, and repo.md are ALWAYS generated (not listed).
The full list of docs to generate = all docs MINUS whatever the user skipped.
If user presses enter (skips nothing): all docs are generated (most common case).

### Step 1.4 - Save state

Write `.docs-state.tmp`:
```
phase: 2
type: {monorepo|single}
parts: {comma-separated paths, e.g. apps/api,apps/web - empty for single repo}
docs: {comma-separated list of selected docs}
```

Tell the user: "Setup complete. Selected {N} doc types for {type} project. Launching discovery agents..."

Proceed to `## Phase 2`.
